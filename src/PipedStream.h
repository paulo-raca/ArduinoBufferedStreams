/*
 * PipedStreams are created in pairs, and all data written to one of the streams can be read on the other
 * 
 * If any of the internal buffers overflows, the last bytes written are lost.
 *
 * Alt use: pass out_stream to constructor, and data will be written if the buffer is filled, or on flush()
 * Use out_stream and buffer_size=1 to bypass buffering completely (for first PipedStream of pair)
 * Example use case: connect object that uses a single Stream to take input from one source, and output to another, without overflowing output buffer
 *
 * Use fillFromStream(in_stream) in loop() to write as much data as available from Stream into buffer
 * 
 * It can be used as a Serial or Socket-like layer between components.
